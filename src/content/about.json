  "intro":"Junior Software Engineer, with a background in freelance consulting and Product Management.<br><br>I recently moved into the Digital world after a decade in more physical industries, freelancing in finance and consulting. Whilst supporting CodeYourFuture from a Product Management perspective, I found myself spending evenings unsticking engineering and data problems, and building automated tests. I (finally) realised that the fun I’ve had in past roles was in spending my own time building cloud integration tools with Powershell and C++, and easy-to-use bookkeeping packages with Excel and VBA.<br>I’ve solidified my self-taught skills with General Assembly’s bootcamp, and I’m excited about building full-featured applications whilst having a hand in developing the web3 and DeFi tools that deliver value to business and customers."
